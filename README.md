# Vibration Spectral Analysis 

The present work was motivated by a challenge, where we had access to acceleration data in 3 orthogonal axes. The data was collected from a fridge compressor. 
The main three question that should be answered were:
 1. The RPM frequency through a spectral analysis
 2. Create an algorithm that computes the amount of Uptime and Downtime in the given samples
 3. Analyze the behavior of the machine and predict its state, inform if there is any fault and of which kind.

 
 The information below was given:
